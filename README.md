This is an attempt to build a multiplayer modification framework referencing mainly Artix Entertainment free to play Epic Duel browser based video game. This was developed with a very limited knowledge of C# and currently serve as a demonstration of its feasibility. It is not intended to be by any mean stable.

Note that you'll be required to fork the ![AxShockwaveFlash](https://github.com/samishii/AxShockwaveFlash) repository. An hex editor attached to the Edem process is obligatory to figure out Items ID. Search for a string based on http://epicduelwiki.com/ 

`^Beta Blaster -> ^490^Beta Blaster -> 490 is the id.`
